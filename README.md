<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Loise Jabson Rada</h1>
<h3 align="center">A 4th-year BS Computer Science Student in UPLB. I am currently taking CMSC 100 Web development as one of my courses. What people should know about me is that I am originally from Santa Rosa, Laguna and that I have 1 sister. I do not have personal projects that much as I focus on my academic projects, but recently I worked on a project at my internship in UPOU called ABACUS which is a plugin that helps automate the migration of course and account data in their systems. I have knowledge in programming languages such as Python, C, Java, and PHP. My hobbies include watching television series.</h3>
